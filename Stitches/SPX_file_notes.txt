Numbers are signed 16bit big endian

Something in the header changes its length (not only the produced with string).
This can be seen when comparing the offsets from a file created by the stitch creator to a file that is preloaded on the machine.
Here the stitches start at a different offset for each file instead of the "fixed" 0x122 in the example files i created so far.

Stitch creator on the machine describes is files as: Produced with APF498
The files that came preloaded on the machine describe themselves as: Produced with VSM_SD library

VMS = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSM_Group

These offsets are only valid for stitches created with the on machine stitch ceator!

Offset		Datatype		Function

0x00-0x04	string			Magic string %spx%
0x0A-0x0B	short			Length of file in bytes after this value
0x0C-0x0D	short			Length of produced with string
0x0E-?		string			Produced with string (16 bit unicode big endian)
0x3B-0x3C	short			Length of file in bytes after this value
0x44-0x45	short			Length of something / offset to whatever 01 05 01 is (the value 01 05 01 can be found in all files even those preloaded on the machine)
0x67-0x68	short			Total height of stitch pattern in mm*1000
0xA0-0xA1	short			Total width of stitch pattern in mm*1000
0xA4-0xA5	short			Maximum width the machine supports (in case of quilt expression 720 = 9mm > 9000)
0xE9-0xEA					FFFF when stitch offset is set negative
0xEB-0xEC	short			Offset of the whole stitch on the x axis * 1000 (left = negative)
0xF1		byte			Tapering on start enabled = 3
0xF2		byte			Tapering on end enabled = 3
0xF3		byte			Angle for taper on start
0xF4		byte			Angle for taper on end
0xF5		byte			String tension * 10
0xF8-0xF9	short			Stitch height setting from the sewing mode * 1000
0xFC-0xFD	short			Stitch width setting from the sewing mode * 1000
0x10F-0x110	short			Resolution x axis (0.125mm > 125)
0x113-0x114	short			Resolution y axis (0.125mm > 125)
0x119-0x11A					FFFF when stitch start position is set negative
0x11B-0x11C	short			Start position of the first stitch on the x axis * 1000 (left = negative)
0x122-0x123	short			Length of array of the stitches in bytes
0x124		signed byte		Step count on x axis (relative) from last position to next position
0x125		signed byte		Step count on y axis (relative) from last position to next position
0x126		signed byte		Step count on x...
0x127		signed byte		Step count on y...
0x128		signed byte		and so on...
0x129		signed byte		and so on...


Step counts can be multiplied with the resolution to get the relative position in mm*1000 from the last stitch
