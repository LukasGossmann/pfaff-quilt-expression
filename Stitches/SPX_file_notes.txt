Numbers are signed 16bit big endian

Something in the header changes its length (not only the produced with string).
This can be seen when comparing the offsets from a file created by the stitch creator to a file that is preloaded on the machine.
Here the stitches start at a different offset for each file instead of the "fixed" 0x122 in the example files i created so far.

Stitch creator on the machine describes is files as: Produced with APF498
The files that came preloaded on the machine describe themselves as: Produced with VSM_SD library

VMS = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSM_Group

Offset		Datatype		Function

0x00-0x04	string			Magic string %spx%
0x0C-0x0D	short			Length of produced with string
0x0E-?		string			Produced with string (16 bit unicode big endian)

0x67-0x68	short			Total height of stitch pattern in mm*1000
0xA0-0xA1	short			Total width of stich pattern in mm*1000

0xA4-0xA5	short			Maximum width the machine supports (in case of quilt expression 720 = 9mm > 9000)
0xE9-0xEA					FFFF when stitch is left and right of center
0xEB-0xEC	short			Offset of the whole stitch to the left (negative)

0xFC-0xFD	short			Total width of stich pattern in mm*1000
0xF8-0xF9	short			Total height of stitch pattern in mm*1000

0x10F-0x110	short			Resolution x axis (0.125mm > 125)
0x113-0x114	short			Resolution y axis (0.125mm > 125)

0x119-0x11A					FFFF when stitch is left and right of center
0x11B-0x11C	short			Offset of the stitches to the left (negative)

0x122-0x123	short			Length of array of the stitches in bytes
0x124		signed byte		Step count on x axis (relative) from last position to next position
0x125		signed byte		Step count on y axis (relative) from last position to next position
0x126		signed byte		Step count on x...
0x127		signed byte		Step count on y...
0x128		signed byte		and so on...
0x129		signed byte		and so on...


Step counts can be multiplied with the resolution to get the relative position in mm*1000 from the last stitch
